# Wi-Fi based robot's finding over ESP8285 NodeMCU

##Final project for Distributed Systems I, FIUBA 

In this project, we proposed and implemented a distributed robot's finding algorithm over the well known ESP IoT modules. You can read the [full documentation](https://github.com/AlejandroGarcia95/Zumo32u4-Sist-Dist-I/blob/master/Documentation/documentation.md), watch [this project's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtYlBuLUE_0&feature=youtu.be) or try it out on your own.

List of everything needed:

- Pololu's Zumo 32U4 robots in a desired amount (we used four in our case).
- ESP8285 NodeMCU (or any ESP module), one for each Zumo robot.
- A computer or any other device to use as MQTT broker.
- Any Wi-Fi network to connect the devices to.
- Wires and some other common materials for making the PCBs connecting the robots to their ESPs (check the preliminary section of the documentation).
